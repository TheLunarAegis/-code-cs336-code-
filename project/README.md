Idea:
Make a homework tracker app.  This app would include an entry for deadlines,
titles, classes, descirptions and a scheduled time of completion.  This app
can and will be used for next semester between the two of us (partner stated below).

I would like to work on this assignment with Sean Jacobsma.
