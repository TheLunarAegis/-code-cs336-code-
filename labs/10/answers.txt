10.	1.	a.	I like MongoDB better.
			SQL seems more straigth forward and confusing, but more customizable.
		b.	There would be no possibility for redundancy by the company, only on your end.
			I could not access it from another machine, unless it's on shared storaged.
		c.	No, there is no redundancy.

10.	2.	a.	It was better to run "npm start" because it was more streamlined for the user,
			not the developer.  The goal of this was for the user, not the dev.
		b.	It changes the collection as the app would, just without running the app.
			The app also updates on runtime.
		c.	I think this would work best with a NoSQL database, because Mongodb is a NoSQL
			database, and it worked much better for this kind of application in my
			experience.
