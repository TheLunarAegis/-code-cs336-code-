Realistic Ideas:

Meme Soundboard
--Press a button, and it playes a corresponding sound
  Could also record/upload sounds

Super Simple Chat
--Chatroom with light or dark theme
  Consisting of only name, timestamp, and text
  Nothing fancy, just chat


Non-Realistic Ideas:

Nuke Code Sender
--It's a big button, and when you press it, it outputs a
  statement containing some satyrical fake nucular codes

Phone Crasher
--Crashes your phone upon pressing the start button, using errors

Dat Boi Simulator
--Basically Temple run, but with Dat Boi
